# MERN Capstone Project: Resumeflow-AI

## Overview
Resumeflow-AI is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. This project serves as my Week 8 Capstone assignment for the PLP MERN Stack Development program. It aims to provide a robust platform for [**Explain what Resumeflow-AI specifically does here. For example: "creating, managing, and showcasing professional resumes." or "automating the resume creation process using AI assistance." Be specific to your project's core functionality.**]

## Live Application
You can access the deployed application online here:

* **Express.js:** Web application framework for Node.js.
* **Mongoose:** ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
* **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** For authentication and authorization.
* **Bcrypt.js:** For password hashing.
* **Dotenv:** For managing environment variables.
* **[Add any other specific backend libraries, e.g., Multer for file uploads, Nodemailer for email, Cloudinary for image hosting]**

### Database
* **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing application data.

### Development Tools
* **Git:** Version control system.
* **GitHub:** For hosting the repository.
* **Postman:** For API testing.
* **[Add any other tools, e.g., VS Code, ESLint, Prettier]**

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
* **Node.js** (v14.x or higher recommended)
* **npm** (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js) or **Yarn**
* **MongoDB:**
    * **Local Installation:** [Link to MongoDB Community Server download, or instructions on how to install via package manager]
    * **Cloud (MongoDB Atlas):** [Link to MongoDB Atlas, if you used it]

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Navigate to the directory where you want to store your project and clone the repository.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/denn1s-mutuku/mern-capstone.git](https://github.com/denn1s-mutuku/mern-capstone.git)
    cd mern-capstone/resumeflow-AI
    ```

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    Navigate into the `server` directory and install the required packages.
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install # or yarn install
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    Navigate into the `client` directory and install the required packages.
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install # or yarn install
    cd ..
    ```

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the **`server/`** directory (at the same level as `package.json` in the server folder).
    * Add the following environment variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration.

    ```dotenv
    # MongoDB Connection URI (e.g., from MongoDB Atlas or local)
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/resumeflow_db

    # JSON Web Token Secret (generate a strong, random string)
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here

    # Port for the backend server
    PORT=5000

    # [Add any other environment variables your project uses, e.g., CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME, CLOUDINARY_API_KEY, CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET, EMAIL_SERVICE_USER, EMAIL_SERVICE_PASS]
    ```

### Running the Application

After installation and environment setup, you can run the application.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    Open your terminal/Git Bash, navigate to the `server` directory, and start the server.
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```
    The server will typically run on `http://localhost:5000` (or the `PORT` you specified in `.env`).

2.  **Start the Frontend Client:**
    Open a **new** terminal tab/window, navigate to the `client` directory, and start the React development server.
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```
    The frontend application will usually open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
